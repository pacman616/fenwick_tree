# fenwick_tree

  A [Fenwick tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree) is a data
  structure for mantaining the cumulative frequencies wich are needed to support
  dynamic arithmetic data compression. 

  In the following implementations relies on some assumptions about the
  cumulative sequence: each increment is at most 63 (exactly 6 bit long).
